## Module description
### 1. Modules
This project has three modules: GPS, LOAM and Calibration.

#### 1.1 GPS module
This module processes GPS data and transforms them into local coordinate system.

#### 1.2 LOAM module
LOAM, Laser Odometry and Mapping, is a real-time method for state estimation and mapping using 3D lidar. The program contains two major threads running in parallel. 

The "odometry" thread computes motion of the lidar between two sweeps, at a higher frame rate. It also removes distortion in the point cloud caused by motion of the lidar. The "mapping" thread takes the undistorted point cloud and incrementally builds a map, while simultaneously computes pose of the lidar on the map at a lower frame rate. The lidar state estimation is combination of the outputs from the two threads.

To learn more about LOAM, please refer to:

http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/%7Ejizhang03/Publications/RSS_2014.pdf

This package is a simple modified copy of loam_velodyne GitHub repository from laboshinl, which is again a modified copy of the original one release by Ji Zhang. His change on top of the original one is that he changed the scanRegistration.cpp to make it work with his dataset.

If you want to get laboshinl, pleaser go to:
https://github.com/laboshinl/loam_velodyne

We modified some codes in laserOdometry.cpp and scanRegistration.cpp to match the data generated by the lidar we use, and added some codes on transformMaintenance.cpp to get lidar's track with timestamp and map. Both are in txt format.

#### 1.3 Calibration module
This module calls GPS module and LOAM module and use their data as input.

We use timestamped point set registration to match GPS and LOAM tracks in two steps. First, we calculate long LOAM segments and find their least absolute deviations with GPS track by means of iteratively re-weighted least squares. Second, the weights from the first step are used to register overlapping short LOAM segments with GPS track by means of weighted least squares.

The final output is calibrated GPS track. We only work on 2D GPS tracks in this version. Altitudes are set to a constant for the purpose of demonstration in Google Earth.

## How to compile and run the project
1.*Make sure that you have the message bag. it includes follow message types
  sensor_msgs/PointCloud2. and GPS coordinates matched with your run trail although 
  GPS is not accurate and not continuous in time.
  If you don’t have lidar or GPS data, don’t worry, we have some data in advance for you to have a try.*
#### point cloud data: http://www.imorpheus.ai/download/dataForDemo/bagDemo
#### GPS data: http://www.imorpheus.ai/download/dataForDemo/original_gps_data
  

2.*Open the globalConfig.py in directory "iMorpheusAI/"
  set needed file directory correctly.*

3.*In directory "iMorpheusAI", run command :*

```
$ catkin_make 
$ source setup.sh
$ mkdir data
```

4.*Okay, you can run ./run.py.*

5.*Finally, you get a global position system coordinates matched with your run trail. It is accurate and reliable!*

## About system input and output
### 1. Input
#### 1.1 .bag
##### 1.1.1 What is .bag?
A bag is a file format in ROS for storing ROS message data.
 
#### 1.2 GPS
##### 1.2.1 GPS format
The GPSRMC is protocol of GPSRMC's communication, and the format is that:
$GPRMC,085223.136,A,3957.6286,N,11619.2078,E,0.06,36.81,180908,,,A\*57

### 2. Output
*The results of the program are stored in /data. We provide calibrated GPS in kml formats.
If you want to see GPS track in Google Earth, you need to use kml.
You can find Google Earth here: https://developers.google.com/kml/?hl=en-US.*
