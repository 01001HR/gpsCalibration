#Lidar SLAM

## Input data
Get message form sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 at a rate of one message per second. Slam track distance can be customized, as well as overlap distance.

## LOAM
LOAM algorithm from J. Zhang and S. Singh. Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time.

LOAM, Laser Odometry and Mapping, is a real-time method for state estimation and mapping using 3D lidar. The program contains two major threads running in parallel.
 
The "odometry" thread computes motion of the lidar between two sweeps, at a higher frame rate. It also removes distortion in the point cloud caused by motion of the lidar.
 
A "mapping" thread takes the undistorted point cloud and incrementally builds a map, while simultaneously computes pose of the lidar on the map at a lower frame rate.
 
The lidar state estimation is combination of the outputs from the two threads.

This package is a simple modified copy of loam_velodyne GitHub repository from laboshinl, which is again a modified copy of the original one release by Ji Zhang.
His change on top of the original one is that he changed the scanRegistration.cpp to make it work with his dataset.

We modified some codes in laserOdometry.cpp and scanRegistration.cpp to match the data generated by the lidar of ourselves, and added some codes on transformMaintenance.cpp to get lidar's track with time    stamp and map. Both are in txt format.

### Input
Bag list, including each bag path

### Output
SLAM track file: x y z t
